If you've spent enough time on the internet, you'll definitely come across terms that you know have something to do with character encoding, but not exactly sure about it. These terms including UTF-8, ASCII, Unicode, and ISO-8859-1.  
There are plethora of articles (see the _References_ section) out there that goes in detail about these different terms. Hence, this article doesn't aim to provide any further insight. It shall merely serves to document the mystery behind character encoding for my own future reference.
